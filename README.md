# VBA-challenge
Homework for the VBA portion of Bootcamp

There are 3 items in the VBAStocks folder.
1. The screenshots for each year are in the one powerpoint presentation, called "Screenshots.pptx".
2. 2 vbs files
  
  A. summarizeStock.vbs - this will loop through the worksheets and calculate the yearly change for each stock, recording it in a summary table to the right of the original data.  Code runs on my desktop in 23.43 seconds.
  
  B. calcMax.vbs - this will loop through the newly created summary table and pull out the 3 stocks with: largest percent increase, largest percent decrease and the largest volume.  Sub is pretty quick.
